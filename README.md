##MY Personal Website##
=======================


####Summary####
I first programmed my first website in grade 10 at the age of 14 when I first learned HTML and CSS. Back then, HTML5 and CSS3 were not invented. However, I recently updated this website with HTML5 and some CSS3.


####This is my Current Website####
This is my current website, so if you want to visit this, you can actually just click the link in my github profile or go here --> ece.uwaterloo.ca/~zu2syed


####Some Problems####
There are some problems that I could have fixed if I had more time, and if I made this website from scarth (and not just update it). First, I made this website with px values, which means that it may not fit in all browser for computers, and it really goes bad in mobile devices. Now I have utilized % values, so that it covers mobile devices properly and most computers. However, there are still a lot of px values used.
