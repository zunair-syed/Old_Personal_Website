##My Old Personal Website##

####Summary####
I first programmed my first website in grade 10 at the age of 14 when I first learned HTML and CSS. I recently updated this website with HTML5 and some CSS3.


####This is my Current Website####
This is features my hobbies, interests, projects, and a bunch of other things. Please visit my <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~zu2syed/index.html" >Old Personal Wesbite</a>.
For the newer site, visit <a href="https://zunair-syed.github.io/" >zunairsyed.me</a>.


####Why not just use a template?####
This website is made purely with HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript. I have not used any third party libraries/templates/frameworks even though it may produce a better looking UI/UX. I personally believe that making products out of the scratch gives you an in depth coverage of the technologies used. I could have just used Bootstrap, but I then I wouldn't have been able to fully architect my website creating all CSS classes on my own. However, Your Mileage May Vary with this debate.
