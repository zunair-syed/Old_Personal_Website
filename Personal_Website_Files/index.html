						"Path of Ants" is a fantastic Android Application that challenges your eye to hand coordination, as well as your decision making process.
					It's a simple concept where you save the ant from entering the restricted space by making sure that the ant stays on the designated path.
					The game features a high FPS refresh rate, intuitive GUI, and stunning graphics. Challenge your friends, and save the ants!

					<p id="main_section_writtenstuff">This movie does lack a lot of depth, but not for the lack of trying. 
					It tries to be something more than a simple summer action movie which is where I believe it failed. 
					Mark Walhberg does a good job of playing a single Texan father trying to put his daughter through college.
