					<p class="written_section" >This movie does lack a lot of depth, but not for the lack of trying. 
					It tries to be something more than a simple summer action movie which is where I believe it failed. 
					Mark Walhberg does a good job of playing a single Texan father trying to put his daughter through college.
					He pulls off the part quite well, but it seems most of the other human actors do not particularly do a good job.
					The transformers special effects and CGI once again are around the same quality (which is still very good).
					Most of the action sequences are pretty well choreographed and have great cinematic angles, but at the third act of the movie, the angles do get a bit sloppy.
					Some of the lore in the movie is not explained, which may lead some to ask many questions about what is going on, especially with the Dinobots.
					If you went into this movie for Dinobots, this movie has very little of them and they do not make the movie.
					Bringing it back to the idea that the movie tried to be too deep for its own good, the movie has too much lore in it.
					Its excess story lines (the Dinobots for example) just make the movie too long for many moviegoers and even action fans.
					This movie is therefore is not for everyone to watch.  If you don't mind Bay's interpretation of the Transformers and you like Mark Wahlberg's acting,  then this movie might be a movie for you.
					Otherwise this movie may make you gripe more.  But, overall this movie, is by far not the worst movie ever or even the worse movie of the franchise. </p>

				The film, simply put, was spectacular and builds upon its predecessor, Rise of the Planet of the Apes. 
				It takes place after the worldwide epidemic caused by the simian flu (the virus in the first movie that was seen at the end being carried by someone at the airport and being the same virus that caused the apes to grow in mental capacity.) 
				The remaining humans in one area end up in a confrontation with the mentally growing apes led by Caesar, the main ape in the first movie.  
				Andy Serkis plays the role of Caesar extremely well with the proper balance of ape-like and human-like behaviour, so as to not let us forget that they are apes, but to also allow us to realize that these apes are also becoming more and more human.  
				The other apes are done well and the CGI and special effects used are extraordinary to look at due to the amount of realism in them and the emotional exemplification.  
				The human actors also do a very good job at portraying the different sorts of archetypal characters that would exist during a possible war (the peace keeper, the war maker, and so forth).
				In the movie, it can be seen that the archetypes used in the ape colony are matched with their equals in the human colony creating a sort of irony in the fact that they believe that they are better than the other colony, when in reality they are both quite similar.
				The film as a whole, also delivers the proper balance of action and drama within it, providing drama lovers and action lovers alike the experience they've been waiting for. 
				This movie proves to be a great addition to the Planet of the Apes franchise for it improves on it.  
				If you are a fan of the original series of Planet of the Apes (the movies before Rise of the Planet of the Apes), you will love this movie for it has a deep moral story to tell about apes and humans just like the originals.

					Though this movie may not be the greatest horror experience ever, it is at the very least a decent one and is unlike the other horror movies of this year. 
					The film is overall a good balance between a cop movie and exorcist movie at the same time.  
					Eric Bana does a good job at playing a cop who at first doesn't believe in the paranormal activities, however, by the end she does in order to solve the mystery at hand. 
					The exorcist that helps Eric Bana's character, and the cop himself, are quite strong characters and feel like they come out of the Hellblazer/ John Constantine comic books, which seems refreshing since we always seem to get protagonists that are scared mostly.
					The visuals are quite graphic and frightening, which is always a plus for a horror movie.  The movie contains many jump scares that keep people on their feet for sometimes they are of supernatural or just normal origin. 
					Though this movie does follow the stereotypical formula of a generic horror movie, it is decent enough in its approach.  
					Therefore, this movie is a decent horror addition to this summer.</p>
