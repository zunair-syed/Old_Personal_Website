					<h2 >Spaceship Game</h2>
					
					<article>
					The Spaceship Game used to be my showcase project that I finished at the age of 14.
					My instructors were fascinated by my coding skills that I was able to make such an action game, while my fellow class mates enjoyed their simple quiz games.
					This game was coded on the Turing platform, and uses basic programming concepts such as variable utilization, loops and methods.
					This project is invaluable to me, because it sparked my passion for programming.

					<article>
						I first created this website when I was only 14 years old. At that time, I utilized CSS and HTML(4). However, recently I had decided that I wanted to upgrade my website.
						So now, the UI of this website is very user friendly, and looks much better cosmetically. I have utilized HTML5 and CSS3 as much as I could possibly to update this site.
